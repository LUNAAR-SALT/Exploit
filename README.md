# 🚀 Open Source Roblox Exploits 🚀

Delve into our collection of open-source codes crafted mainly for exploits on Roblox. While we advise following Roblox's Terms of Use, we acknowledge that the choice ultimately rests with the user. 🎮

ℹ️ I embarked on creating this repository to expand my knowledge of Roblox coding. I've developed various codes, including ESP and hitbox, aiming not only to explore exploits but also to assist game developers in their projects. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
