# 🚀 Open Source Roblox Exploits 🚀

Welcome to our collection of open-source codes for Roblox! While primarily designed for exploits, you're free to adapt them for your own game. 🎮

⚠️ Keep in mind that exploiting may violate Roblox's Terms of Service, so it's advisable to adhere to their guidelines. However, the choice is yours.
